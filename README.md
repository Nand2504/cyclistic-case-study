This is the powerpoint of my very first mock case study that I completed on my own to put my data analytics skills to the test. This data was taken from the months of August-November in the year 2024. I used aspects of R, Excel, and a little bit of SQL in order to complete this case study. The objective of this was to find out how annual members and casual riders use cyclistic, a bike share program out of Chicago, differently and to give a marketing team some insight on how they could create a campagin to help convert casual riders into annual members.
